        Have you ever set up a really long path name for source code or
        other things? It can get pretty annoying having to type in a 20
        character long path name just to  change directory.  Of course,
        you can always write a  batch file to do the directory setting,
        but that's really a bit clumsy, and I believe I've got a better
        solution.  This program will take an AKA (Also Known As) as the
        command line parameter and then do a match to find out what the
        real name on the drive should be.

        The first thing the program does is to look for a file with the
        same name, but with an extension of .AKA, so if you happened to
        rename DX.COM to CD2.COM then it'll look for CD2.AKA instead of
        DX.AKA. The .AKA file is just a text file (size limited to 50k)
        with the name of the AKA followed by the path it refers to (the
        AKA and the path should be separated by white space,  i.e. tabs
        or spaces.)

        If the file DX.AKA contained the following line:

                WORK C:\PROG\SOURCE\BASIC

        then entering "DX WORK" on the command line would set the drive
        to C: and the directory to "\PROG\SOURCE\BASIC". Pretty useful,
        I think you'll agree. There's an example DX.AKA for you to look
        at which should explain everything.

        The only requirements are that the DX.AKA file should be in the
        same directory as the program and that you're using DOS 3.10 or
        later.

        * NEW IN THIS VERSION! *
        Now you can also specify a path to append to the AKA. So if you
        entered "DX WORK PROJECT" it would set the current directory to
        C:\PROG\SOURCE\BASIC, and then attempt to move into the PROJECT
        below that (i.e. C:\PROG\SOURCE\BASIC\PROJECT). This is quite a
        good compromise between typing in DX etc. then changing down to
        another directory, and defining a new AKA which wouldn't really
        be much different from others already there.


        * PAYMENT *

        This program is totally FREE, you're not obliged to pay a thing
        for it, or even feel guilty about not paying for it! After all,
        it only took about an hour to knock together so I've hardly put
        my life's work into it (but of course, it probably doesn't work
        perfectly either... ;-)

                                                        Kevin Phair.

        BTW, the X stands for whatever you want, I can't decide whether
        to call it directory extender, directory expander of whatever.


        History:

        Version 1.00 (not released.) Had a few (two) bugs. Didn't check
        the availability of a drive either.

        Version 1.10 (first released version.) Fixed those naughty bugs
        and, erm, released it...

        Version 1.20 (this version.) Added the ability to specify a
        further path to change further down into after the AKA takes
        effect.

        Version 1.30 (RSN) Will ask if you want to see your aka list
        if you enter a non-existent AKA name.

        a station which plays metal, not to much to ask really, is it?)
